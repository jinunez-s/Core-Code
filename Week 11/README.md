## S.O.L.I.D.

It is a set of standards or rules for building code, among them is to make the code more readable, scalable and easy to detect errors. The name solid comes from the acronym of: 

* Single responsability
* Open Closed
* Liskov Substitution 
*  Interface Segregation
* Dependency Inversion

### Single responsability

A class should be delegated a single responsibility.

### Open Closed

Inheritance and polymorphism should be used to add functionality, new functions should be created and code reuse should be avoided. 

### Liskov Substitution

Any class that is a child of a class must be able to be used as if it were the same parent class. The child class has the ability to use methods of the parent class but appropriate to its functionality. Polymorphism.

### Interface Segregation

The client should not be exposed to methods it doesn't need. This avoid of getting bulky or fat interfaces. 

### Dependecy Inversion

High level modules should not depend on low level modules, but should depend on interfaces. It is based on the principle of abstraction. The functionality of the code should not be affected if the database framework is changed, for example.
