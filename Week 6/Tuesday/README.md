## OOP Glosary
1. <b>Abstraction:</b> Abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes, abstraction is the property which only the essential details are displayed to the user. 
2. <b>Inheritance:</b> Is the mechanism by which one class is allowed to inherit the features of another class. Inherit fields and methods. 
3. <b>Polymorphism:</b> Allows to perfom a single action in different ways, polymorphism allows to define one interface and have multiple implementations. 
4. Encapsulation: Defines a protective shield that prevents the data form being accessed by the code outside this shield. The data can be only accessed through any member function of its own class in which is declared.  
5. Class: Is a user defined blueprint which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. 
6. Object: It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the entities. An object consist of, state that represents the attributes and properties of an object, behavior that represents the methods of the object, and identity that gives an unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects. 
7. Instance:  Instances are group of methods that performs a particulas task. Instance method can access instance variables and instance methods directly and undeviatingly. 
8. Interface: Is an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a class. An interface is a blue print of a class.
9. Access Modifiers: Are keywords that helps to restrics the scope of a class, constructor, variable,  method, or data member. They are default (no keyword required), public, private, and protected.
10. Constructors: They are special methods that initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for objects attributes.
