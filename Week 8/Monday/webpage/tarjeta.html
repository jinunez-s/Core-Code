                    <h1>Julio Nuñez</h1>
                    <p>I started programming with youtube videos because I always found computer science interesting, when I finished my degree in chemical engineering I decided to enroll in a programming course oriented to front end development where I learned to use HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap and other technologies such as Git and Github that are used for version control. I am very grateful to the people who have helped me to learn in a more demanding and faster way in order to fit the job hiring profiles.  Here are some aspects of why I study these technologies. </p>

                </div>
                <p>Among so many programming languages I am very interested in object-oriented programming languages such as Java, typescript, which is a language derived from javascript, it is a typed language and personally I really like the development with that technology.</p>
